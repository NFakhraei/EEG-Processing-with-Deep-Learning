# Introduction
In this project, a collection of different deep learning models implemented to process EEG Signals (currently motor imagery signals) are provided. The codes are easy to track and can be easily reproduced. This repo keeps updated.
# Implemented Models
* Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
