# Introduction
In this project, a collection of different deep learning models implemented to process EEG Signals (currently motor imagery signals) are provided. The codes are easy to track and can be easily reproduced. This repo keeps updated.
# Implemented Models
* Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
# Data
* BCI comp IV dataset 2b
This data contains motor imagery EEG signals of 9 subjects. The task is a 2-class classification (Right/Left hand). 
# Usage
* DNN
